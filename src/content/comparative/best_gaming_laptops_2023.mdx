## Overall Best Gaming Laptop: Lenovo Legion Pro 7i

[BUY IT!](https://amzn.to/48fKcjM)

The Lenovo Legion Pro 7i stands out as the overall best gaming laptop available now. It combines excellent performance with a grown-up, non-flashy aesthetic and a reasonable price given the high-end components inside.

Specifically, the Legion Pro 7i model with the Intel Core i9-13900HX CPU, Nvidia RTX 4080 graphics, 32GB RAM, and 1TB SSD offers desktop-like gaming speeds in a slim 16-inch chassis weighing just 6 pounds. The 16:10 QHD+ screen is vibrant and immersive. Lenovo also avoided the extreme price premiums we're seeing on many new RTX 4000 laptops.

Gaming performance beats out even more expensive rivals like the Razer Blade 16 with RTX 4090 graphics. The Legion Pro 7i runs quietly too thanks to Lenovo's focus on balanced power delivery. Really an exceptionally well-balanced machine.

The main drawbacks are merely average battery life and a screen that, while great, lacks the visual pop of mini LED options. But overall the Legion Pro 7i is the best mix of power, price, and portability in a gaming laptop today.

## Best Budget Gaming Laptop: Gigabyte G5

[BUY IT!](https://amzn.to/4aDDgOI)

If you want strong 1080p gaming performance at a wallet-friendly price, the Gigabyte G5 2023 model is my top recommendation. By putting an Nvidia RTX 4060 or 4050 GPU into last year's chassis design, Gigabyte created an under $900 gaming laptop that doesn't skimp on power.

The RTX 4060 in particular delivers outstanding frame rates for the price. Gigabyte allows it to run at a full 75W, higher than competing entry-level RTX 4000 laptops like the MSI Cyborg 15. This allows it to outperform even laptops with superior CPUs in gaming tests.

You'll have to live with louder fans when gaming and a lack of storage space out of the box. But the G5 otherwise feels very solid, with a nice bright 1080p 144Hz screen, sleek chassis, and easy upgradability. For affordable big-name gaming power, it's hard to beat the G5's value.

## Top 15-Inch Gaming Laptop: Razer Blade 15

[BUY IT!](https://amzn.to/3NHHIlR)
For a premium 15-inch gaming laptop, the Razer Blade 15 remains my top choice. It packs desktop-class gaming prowess into a stunning 0.7-inch thick aluminum chassis weighing just 4.4 pounds.

Configurations are available with up to an Intel Core i9-13900H CPU and Nvidia RTX 40-series graphics, up to a blazing fast 360Hz 1080p or 240Hz 1440p display, and immersive per-key RGB lighting. Build quality is unmatched and battery life impressive for such powerful specs.

The main limitations come from the slim design itself. Heat throttling can impact max performance, especially on higher-end configs. And of course, Razer charges a premium for this level of craftsmanship, putting the Blade 15 out of reach for budget buyers. But if you want a true gaming-workhorse in a MacBook-esque shell, the Blade 15 is hard to beat.

## Best 14-Inch Gaming Laptop: Asus ROG Zephyrus G14
![Asus ROG Zephyrus G14](/src/assets/comparative_laptop_gaming_4.jpeg)
[BUY IT!](https://amzn.to/3O5f2nd)

For gaming on the go, the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 packs a punch into a super portable 14-inch magnesium alloy chassis weighing just 3.8 pounds. The latest 2023 model pairs AMD's stellar new Ryzen 9 7940HS processor with up to an Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU and 165Hz QHD display.

Ignore that high-end RTX 4090 config though—the G14 can't fully handle it. More reasonably equipped models like those with the RTX 4060 strike the right balance, delivering awesome 1080p gaming speeds from a compact 3.8 pound laptop with 9+ hours of real world battery life.

The keyboard is comfortable with well-spaced keys and the new Nebula HDR mini LED display option blows away competitors visually. If you want serious gaming power in a supremely portable package, the 2023 Zephyrus G14 is an outstanding choice. Just don't overspec the graphics.

## Best 17-Inch Gaming Laptop: Asus ROG Strix Scar 17

[BUY IT!](https://amzn.to/48fKkzM)

On the opposite end of the spectrum, the hulking Asus ROG Strix Scar 17 delivers no compromises max-specs gaming power. The latest 2023 Scar 17 model pairs AMD's phenomenal new 16-core Ryzen 9 7945HX CPU with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU and up to a 240Hz QHD screen, creating one of the most outrageously powerful gaming laptops available.

With this combo, frame rates in demanding titles soar. The Scar 17 can outperform even vastly more expensive competitors, thanks in part to Asus' focus on performance over aesthetics. It's also the only laptop currently offering AMD's special Ryzen 9 7945HX3D version with extra cache for added gaming speed.

Downsides are poor battery life of around 1 hour while gaming, loud fans, and questionable ergonomics. But if your priority is no-limits gaming power in a 17-inch desktop replacement under $3500, nothing beats the Scar 17's performance at its price point right now.

## Conclusion

In closing, there are a lot of great gaming laptop options in 2023. Focus on finding the right balance of performance, price, and portability to suit your specific needs. I hope these detailed breakdowns of some of the top contenders across various categories helps summarize what to look for and consider when purchasing a new high-end gaming laptop this year.
